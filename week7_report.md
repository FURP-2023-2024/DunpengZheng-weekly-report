## Unitree Go1 Robot Communication and ORB-SLAM Implementation

### Objectives

1. Establish communication with the Unitree Go1 quadruped robot.
2. Learn and implement the ORB-SLAM algorithm on the Unitree Go1 robot.
3. Access and utilize the Intel RealSense camera data.

### Achievements

#### Communication with Unitree Go1 Robot

- Successfully established communication between workstation and the Unitree Go1 robot.

#### Accessing Camera Data

- Connected the Intel RealSense camera to the Go1 robot via USB.
- Accessed the camera data as a ROS topic.
- Verified the camera feed and ensured the data was being published correctly to the ROS topic.

#### ORB-SLAM Algorithm

- Studied the basics of the ORB-SLAM algorithm, focusing on its implementation details and dependencies.
- Set up the development environment for ORB-SLAM, ensuring compatibility with the Go1 robot's system.
- Installed necessary libraries and dependencies required for ORB-SLAM.
- Integrated the ORB-SLAM algorithm with the RealSense camera data for real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) processing.


### Conclusion

This week marked significant progress in establishing a functional communication setup with the Unitree Go1 robot and integrating the ORB-SLAM algorithm. The challenges faced were effectively addressed, laying a strong foundation for future developments in autonomous navigation and mapping.
