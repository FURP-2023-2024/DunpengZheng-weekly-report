2. Finished watching ros 21 talks
Having learned about important instructions of ubuntu system terminal, and became more familiar with topic communication and service communication of ros. I completed topic communication and service communication by running turtlesim instance, and learned more about the relationship between different nodes through commands such as rqt -- graph.
# Week 2

However, the demo bag link on the official website was found to be invalid, so the installation of cartographer could not be verified. However, the VMware could not be started due to some missing files. Therefore, the VMware was reconfigured.
# Week 3
Due to the failure of the demo bag, the verification of cartographer algorithm was transferred to the turtlebot package, the configuration of lua file was completed, and my own map was created through gazebo, and the burger car model was imported to complete the map scanning and creation in rviz.
